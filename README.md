# ferrofluid-plug

As part of other research into a [passive ferrofluid check valve](https://github.com/PubInv/ferrofluidcheckvalve) and a [ferrofluid pump](https://github.com/PubInv/ferrofluid-pump) that Public Invention is doing, 
we need to understand how to make a simple controllable ferrofluid "plug". You could call this a valve, but we are 
really just trying to hold back fluid pressure---that is, to "plug" a tube.

The work is explained in a [poster](https://github.com/PubInv/ferrofluid-plug/blob/main/doc/SolenoidExperimentation.pdf).

This work as been mostly done by Asmi Shirsat with supervision from Robert L. Read.

Over a year, she dis some reaearch which she has written up as a poster. It should using solenoids work but are very weak. 
Our attempt to use horse-shoe magnets failed completely,
but it is possble that we did a poor job building our magnets.
